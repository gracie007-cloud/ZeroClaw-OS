# Quick Start
This guide provides a quick introduction to using ZeroClaw. We'll cover the essential installation steps and running your first Skill.

## Installation Steps

### Step 1: Install Docker Desktop

Download and install Docker Desktop for your operating system:

- **Windows:** Download from [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) and run the installer with default settings
- **macOS:** Download for Apple Silicon or Intel, drag to Applications, and enable the Docker socket in Settings → Advanced
- **Linux:** Install Docker Desktop or docker-ce following the [official instructions](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/linux-install/)

> [!TIP]
> For complete OS-specific installation instructions, see the [full Installation Guide](setup/installation.md#step-1-install-docker-desktop).

### Step 2: Pull the ZeroClaw Image

Using Docker Desktop GUI, search for `agent0ai/zeroclaw` and click Pull, or use the terminal:

```bash
docker pull agent0ai/zeroclaw
```

### Step 3: Run the Container

**Using Docker Desktop:** Go to Images tab, click Run next to `agent0ai/zeroclaw`, open Optional settings, map a host port to container port `80` (use `0` for automatic assignment), then click Run.

**Using Terminal:**

```bash
docker run -p 0:80 agent0ai/zeroclaw
```

The container will start in a few seconds. Find the mapped port in Docker Desktop (shown as `<PORT>:80`).

### Step 4: Open the Web UI and Configure API Key

Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:<PORT>`. The Web UI will show a warning banner about missing API key.

Click **Add your API key** to open Settings and configure:

- **Default Provider:** OpenRouter (supports most models with a single API key)
- **Alternative Providers:** Anthropic, OpenAI, Ollama/LM Studio (local models), and many others
- **Model Selection:** Choose your chat model (e.g., `anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-5` for OpenRouter)

> [!NOTE]
> ZeroClaw supports any LLM provider, including local models via Ollama. For detailed provider configuration and local model setup, see the [Installation Guide](setup/installation.md#choosing-your-llms).

### Step 5: Start Your First Chat

- **Projects** - organize your work into projects
- **Memory** - open the memory dashboard
- **Scheduler** - create and manage planned tasks
- **Files** - open the File Browser

## Example Interaction
Let's ask ZeroClaw to use one of the built-in skills. Here's how:

1. Type "Activate your brainstorming skill" in the chat input field and press Enter or click the send button.
2. ZeroClaw will process your request. You'll see its thoughts and tool calls in the UI.
3. The agent will acknowledge the skill activation and ask you for a follow-up on the brainstorming request.

Here's an example of what you might see in the Web UI at step 3:
